            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>Dear interviewer,</p>
            <h4>【About Me】</h4>
            <p>Thank you for reviewing my resume. My name is William Chen, and I hold a Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from National Chung Hsing University. I have over six years of professional experience, including one year as a Product Design Engineer and five years as an Automation Project Manager at a world-renowned contract manufacturing (CM) company. I am adept at working in an English-speaking environment.</p>
            
            <h4>【Experienced Automation Project Manager】</h4>
            <p>As an Automation Project Manager, I successfully achieved the implementation of over 80 automation projects. I was responsible for ensuring that equipment specifications met producing requirements. As a result, we achieved a 30% reduction in production line manpower. Meanwhile, we also performed automation-friendly modifications, such as redesigning incoming materials, optimizing online processes, and improving workshop layouts. To meet key performance indicators (KPIs), I coordinated with customers to align schedules, machine entry criteria, and Rel. test plan for automation.</p>
            
            <h4>【Role Transition - Automation Supervisor】</h4>
            <p>As an Automation Supervisor, my vision and responsibilities shifted significantly. Beyond achieving KPIs for automation implementation, I also managed departmental resources to enhance efficiency. Leadership in this role required guiding the team rather than focusing solely on individual projects. A key achievement was leading the team to implement automation solutions during the new product introduction (NPI) stage, which involved resource coordination and client negotiations for optimal results. I prioritize assigning team members to roles that best match their skills and fostering their growth. Additionally, I actively participated in team brainstorming sessions to determine the best decisions and carefully supervised the team’s direction to prevent major errors.</p>
            
            <p>I consistently delivered valuable outcomes to my supervisors, including developing a real-time automation monitoring system, establishing an automation lab, and researching novel technologies. To build company-wide automation standards, we defined equipment specification standards, standardized automation designs, and developed comprehensive documentation.</p>
            
            <h4>【Self-Developing】</h4>
            <p>Over the past decade, my focus has been on mechanical engineering. However, I recognize that automation involves more than assembling mechanical structures like “LEGO games.” Electromechanical integration is key to successful automation systems, and Industry 4.0 is becoming a reality. During my personal time, I have studied programming languages and participated in projects that automatically record machine data and upload it to cloud systems.</p>
            
            <h4>【Conclusion】</h4>
            <p>With over seven years of working experience, I have gained extensive knowledge in machining, product design, automation systems, validation processes, and NPI workflows. I am confident that my skills and expertise can contribute significantly to your company’s success. If you are interested in further details, please don’t hesitate to contact me. Thank you for your time.</p>
